# MyIndianHub Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, including our GitHub repository, Discord server, Telegram group, and any other communication channel.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and inclusive of diverse backgrounds and opinions.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment or discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected status.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community leader or contact us at [official.myindianhub@gmail.com](mailto:official.myindianhub@gmail.com). All reports will be kept confidential.

## Consequences

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**: A community leader will respond to the behavior with a clear message outlining why the conduct was inappropriate and, if applicable, how to correct it.

2. **Warning**: If the behavior continues, the individual will be formally warned that their behavior is not acceptable and must be corrected.

3. **Temporary Ban**: If the individual does not correct the behavior after being warned, they may be temporarily banned from the community spaces. The duration of the ban will be decided by the community leaders.

4. **Permanent Ban**: Individuals who do not abide by the Code of Conduct or continue to engage in unacceptable behavior may be permanently removed from the community.
